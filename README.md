# atom-workspace

## Purpose

The use of workspaces is really usefull, I often have dozens of workspace's screens with 1 atom + 1 shell inside them.

It always takes several minutes to open the right projects in the right workspaces, this program allows to define your workspace configurations, and open all your projects in 
a simple command.

## Requirements

- screen
- wmctrl

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity.
